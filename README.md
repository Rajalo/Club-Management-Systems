# Club Management Systems

As someone who's been involved in a wide variety of clubs since high school, I found it helpful to automate some of the more menial tasks such as sending emails and writing up quick announcement scripts using Google Apps Script.

This repo features two iterations of these, one which I developed back in 2018 as a Junior at Ward Melville High School and another as a Freshman at Stony Brook. Of the two, the latter is more intuitive for common use, but the earlier version had more situationally relevant features such as announcement generation, something which makes sense when you can put in an announcement for a school-wide intercom, not so much for a college club.

Hopefully the projects can help those trying to automate parts of their club's operation and learn some of the functionality of Google Apps Script. Examples are linked for both versions.
