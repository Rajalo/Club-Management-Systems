# Secretary Helper

A more cleanly coded version of the Task Manager, I used the Secretary Helper to help with some of the clubs I was a part of in my freshman year. Rather than mimicking a commandline which allows the user to send generated emails, it automatically generates emails based on data in the spreadsheets and sends them to the secretary for proofreading.

It also bolstered member participation, allowing them to add in news articles and upcoming events to notify the membership of. There is also a function which allows for filtering of certain words that may be innappropriate for the target audience. In case there is a failure by the filter, the generated email will be sent to the secretary to check it over. Hopefully these scripts are helpful in fulfilling your needs.
